# Week-1-Introduction-to-python-programmig

# Introducing Python-
  * Python is a high-level, general-purpose and very popular programming language.
  * It is being used in web development, machine learning applications etc.
  * Python programs are generally smaller than the other programmig language.
  * Programmers have to type relatively less and the indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable at the time.
  * Python have  very simple syntax and easy to learn.

# 1. Variables in Python-
  * Variables are used to store data values.
  * Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location .
  * Python variable is also known as an indentation and used to hold value.
  * In Python, we don’t need to specify the data type explicitly—Python infers it automatically.
  * x = 10        (Integer value)
  * name = "Ram"  (String value)
  * pi = 3.14     (Float value)

-- Dynamic Typing: Python allows variables to change type during execution.

-- Naming Rules: Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and cannot use reserved keywords.

# 2. Data Types:
 * Python supports several built-in data types-
   1. int: Stores the integer numbers, Example: x=5
   2. float: Stores the decimal numbers, Example: pi=3.24
   3. str: Stores the text or string, Example: name="Ram"
   4. bool: Stores boolean values either true or false, Example: is_valid=True
   5. list: Stores the ordered,mutable collection, Example: nums=[1,2,3]
   6. tuple: Stores the ordered,immutable collection, Example: t=(1,2)
   7. dict: Stores the key-value pairs, Example: d={"a":1}
   8. set: Stores the unordered, unique elements, Example: s={1,2,3}


# 3. Operators:
* Operators perform operations on variables and values.

    a. Arithmetic Operators:
      They are used to perform mathematical operations like additional,subtraction,multiplication,division.
  
      +, -, *, /, //, %, **
  
    b. Comparison Operators:
     They are used to compare two operands (values or variables) and determine the relationship between them.
  
        ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
  
    c. Logical Operators:
      Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify conditional statements and expressions, enabling more complex decision-making within programs. They work with Boolean values (True or False) and return a Boolean result.
  
        and, or, not
  
    d. Assignment Operators: Assignment operators are used to assign or update the value of a variable. 
      
        =, +=, -=, *=, /=
  
    e. Membership Operators:Membership operators in Python are used to test for the presence of a value within a sequence. 
      
        in, not in
  

# 4. Input and Output:

➤ Input
Used to take user input from the console.

    name = input("Enter your name: ")


➤ Output
Used to display information.

    print("Hello,", name)



# 5. Conditional Statements (if-else)
* Conditional statements control the flow of execution based on conditions.

      age = 18
      if age >= 18:
      print("Eligible to vote")
      else:
      print("Not eligible")
  

-- You can also use elif for multiple conditions.

# 6. Loops
* Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

➤ For Loop:
  
       for i in range(5):
       print(i)
  
-- Iterates over a sequence (like list, tuple, string, or range).

➤ While Loop:

       count = 0
       while count < 5:
       print(count)
       count += 1

-- Continues as long as the condition is True.
